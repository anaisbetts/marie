## The Workflowâ„¢

1. Take a picture, tag Who Is Most Responsible

2. The person gets a message - "This has been sitting here too long! @ani thinks you know what to do!" <Yes> <No> (what happens on No?)

3. Nag messages keep getting sent - to clear them, you have to say Where You Think These Items Should Go

4. If the Mess doesn't get cleared => tell original person, "Take it to the Storage Unit!"

5. If the Mess gets cleared => send it to original person to check
   If it's clean => Send nice message to cleaner
   If it's not clean => Tell person to resubmit it
